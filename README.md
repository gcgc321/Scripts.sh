# SYNOLOGYScripts.sh
# Scripts for DSM in Synology
# This script will delete older back up files in the directories and then keep the oldest and newest back up file
# This will help the NAS not to be bogged down with backup files
# Noticed that one of the engineers was manually deleting files from a 100+ directories and was taking an hour to do each month 
# This would save a lot of time and automate the process
